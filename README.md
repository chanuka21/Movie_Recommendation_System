# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering 📽️

Built a content-based movie recommender system that suggests similar movies based on plot, genre, and cast metadata using NLP and vector similarity techniques. The project aims to enhance user engagement by delivering meaningful, personalized suggestions.

🔍 **Key Features**  
✅ Recommends top 5 similar movies based on user input 🎞️  
✅ Uses TF-IDF vectorization and Cosine Similarity for ranking 🔍  
✅ Clean Flask web interface for real-time movie input and results 🧠  
✅ Built with lightweight design for fast response 🔧  
✅ Scalable approach for larger datasets and genre expansions 🌍

By transforming text metadata into numerical features, this project showcases how NLP and similarity measures can power intelligent search and discovery.

💡 Excited to explore more about personalization and recommender systems!
