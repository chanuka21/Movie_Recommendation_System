🍿 Movie Recommender System with Python & Streamlit 🎬

I recently built a content-based movie recommendation system 
that allows users to select any movie they like and instantly get 5 similar
movie suggestions—with poster previews!

This web app provides a fun, interactive way to explore movie 
connections based on cast, crew, genre, storyline, and keywords.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ User selects any movie from the dropdown

✅ Recommender returns 5 most similar movies

✅ Movie posters fetched dynamically using API

✅ Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn & Streamlit

✅ Clean and responsive front-end for easy use

🧠 Behind the scenes, I:

Combined movie datasets (TMDB + MovieLens)

Engineered a feature-rich metadata soup (cast, crew, genres, overview)

Used CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to calculate movie similarity scores

Connected to TMDB API for real-time poster retrieval

Designed a simple and intuitive Streamlit interface

🎯 This project sharpened my skills in text processing, feature engineering, and API integration,
while allowing me to build a real-world ML application end-to-end.
